                        They were flying all over the place and they were scary and 
                        then they'd come down and they'd suck the soul out of your body

                        As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick sometimes the right thing 
                        to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to 
                        keep Meredith alive, we could power a small fan for two days. You tell me 
                        what's unethical.
